Breaking change to previous DSL. The `maker` now uses `NewGet` instead of `PlanGet`. Fakepoints can now be given files *or* strings for response data - `SetResponse` or `SetResponseDocument`.

## Example

Use it to simulate a third party API in your tests. 

```golang
maker := NewFakepointMaker()
maker.NewGet("https://api.opsgenie.com/v1/json/alert", 200).SetResponse(`{ "code": 200 }`).SetHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
resp, _ := maker.Client().Get("https://api.opsgenie.com/v1/json/alert")
```

## Rationale

After looking at `httptest.ResponseRecorder` I decided it was a bit verbose. I wanted a tidier DSL similar to [Fakeweb](https://github.com/chrisk/fakeweb) and [nock](https://github.com/pgte/nock).

I based my approach about the `http.Client`. The Fakepoint maker lets you stub URLs then calling `maker.Client()` returns a standard client to use.

From here you can execute a request by running a HTTP verb function call on the client:

```
maker.NewGet("http://abc.com", 200).SetResponse("")
resp, err := maker.Client().Get("http://abc.com")
```
Or passing in a request to client.Do(req):

```
maker.NewGet("http://example.com", 200).SetResponse("")
req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "http://example.com", nil)
resp, err := maker.Client().Do(req)
```

## How to use
First, set up the FakepointMaker.

```golang
maker := NewFakepointMaker()
```

From here, set up an endpoint with `maker.NewGet`, `maker.NewPost`, `maker.NewPut`, or `maker.NewDelete`. Also specify the http status code you expect.

```golang
fakepoint := maker.NewGet("https://api.opsgenie.com/v1/json/alert", 200)
```

Response data to be returned may be set with one of two methods on the fakepoint; `SetResponse(..)` or `SetResponseDocument(..)`:

```golang
	fakepoint.SetResponse(`{ "code": 200 }`) //response uses the a string
	fakepoint.SetResponseDocument("./response.json") //response loads the file using ioutil.ReadFile
```

Note, that Fakepoints uses chaining. So you could've just written ``maker.NewGet("https://api.opsgenie.com/v1/json/alert", 200).SetResponse(`{ "code": 200 }`)``

This is, perhaps, unidiomatic Golang; in hindsight the [Must pattern](http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#Must) would have been more appropriate. C'est la vie.

You can chain further calls to set headers and increase the frequency of the endpoint:

``` golang
trip := maker.NewGet("https://api.opsgenie.com/v1/json/alert", 200)
trip.SetResponse(`{ "code": 200 }`).SetHeader("Content-Type", "application/json").Duplicate(1)
```

Fakepoints only have a lifetime of one request *unless* `Duplicate` is used to specify additional call lifetimes.

This call sets the Content-Type in the response header, and increases the amount of times the client will field this request by 1.

Finally, get the http.Client from the FakepointMaker:

```golang
client := maker.Client()
```

This is the regular golang http.Client, with the Roundtripper Transport swapped out to something that can facilitate the test.

Fakepoint will cleanly handle 302s by following redirects, and supplying a 'new-location' resource to automate the follows.

##FAQs

"What's the benefit of fakepoint over http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest?"

The [httptest](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest/) package provides an easy to set up HTTP server for testing and a ResponseRecorder. 

I wanted something different: to specify particular URLs, and to write tests to assert that they were called. With the HTTP Server I couldn't specify the URL and with the ResponseRecorder I had to implement a HTTP handler, etc..

I've used tools like [nock](https://github.com/pgte/nock), [fakeweb](https://github.com/chrisk/fakeweb), etc. in other languages and I wanted something similar.

In particular, I see myself writing a lot of integration code against 3rd party HTTP services, and I want a nice DSL in my tests to prove my code works. All I have to do is expose the call to the client and it's suddenly very testable:

```golang
package notifications_test

import (
	. "github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/convey"
	"testing"
	"github.com/nicholasf/fakepoint"
	"allocation/notifications"
)

func TestOpsgenie(t *testing.T) {
	Convey("An Error log is sent to the notifier", t, func() {
		maker := fakepoint.NewFakepointMaker()
		maker.NewPost("https://api.opsgenie.com/v1/json/alert", 200).SetResponse(`{ "code": 200 }`)
		resp, err := notifications.Requester(*maker.Client(), ("https://api.opsgenie.com/v1/json/alert"), []byte(``))
		So(err, ShouldBeNil)
		So(resp.StatusCode, ShouldEqual, 200)
	})
}

```

"Can I do transfer-coding = "chunked" and get nice responses?"

Not yet, but that'd be grand. I might get around to it if I ever need it.
